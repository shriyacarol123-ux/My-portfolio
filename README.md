🥗 NutriTrack: Building Health With Data
NutriTrack is a full-stack health-tech application designed for personal nutritional accountability. By bridging the gap between daily eating habits and data science, NutriTrack helps users move from "guessing" their health to "knowing" their data.

🎯 Project Overview
NutriTrack is designed to provide a seamless Data Pipeline for tracking caloric intake across different life stages. Whether for a student managing a busy schedule or a professional tracking long-term wellness, this app provides real-time feedback and persistent storage.

💡 Why NutriTrack?
Precision: Replaces vague estimations with an objective "Daily Calorie Speedometer."

Accountability: Provides immediate feedback to help users stay within their nutritional goals.

Data Integrity: Every entry is stored in a structured format, ready for deep statistical analysis.

👥 Target Audience
NutriTrack is an inclusive tool designed for adults (18+) at various life stages:

Students (18-25): Managing energy levels during high-stress exam periods.

Professionals (26-50): Maintaining metabolic health and weight management.

Seniors (50+): Monitoring specific dietary needs and keeping a history for healthcare providers.

🛠️ The Tech Stack (The Ecosystem)
The project is built using a Three-Tier Architecture:

Frontend (The Logger): HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (AOS for animations). Provides the user interface for real-time logging.

Backend (The Brain): Node.js & Express. Handles API routing and processes incoming meal data.

Database (The Vault): MySQL. Ensures all health logs are stored permanently with accurate timestamps.

Analysis (Future Scope): R-Studio. Used for processing the stored SQL data into visual health trends.


📧 System Monitoring & Alerts
NutriTrack includes a built-in Developer Alert System using Node.js and Nodemailer.

Real-Time Monitoring: Every time a new entry is added to the MySQL Health Vault, a summary is instantly routed to the administrator.

Audit Trail: This ensures that the Data Pipeline is functioning correctly and provides a secondary "live log" outside of the database.

Security & Verification: By receiving these alerts, the developer can verify that the REST API is processing inputs accurately before they are committed to long-term storage.


🛡️ Quality Assurance & DevOps
To ensure the reliability of the NutriTrack Data Pipeline, this project incorporates professional software development practices:

Linting: Automated syntax checking to ensure clean, error-free HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Automated Testing: Functional tests to verify that meal logging and calorie calculations are 100% accurate before deployment.

CI/CD Pipeline: Integrated via GitHub Actions. Every update is automatically built, tested, and verified. A "Green Build" status ensures the ecosystem is always production-ready.
